# React 2

## Outline

In this module, we'll continue learning about React. In this module, you'll be creating an actual application that can generate company names based on user input.

Contrary to the to-do list app we've been creating, this application is more focused on performing an action (generate a name) rather than displaying data. This way, you gain a better understanding of how React can be applied in applications of varying nature.

## Centralized state

The focus of this module will be on "centralized state". In the previous module, we would keep our application state within the root `App` component. This meant that all child components required callbacks (`function`-type props) to communicate changes. This would quickly become messy.

Redux and MobX are examples of libraries that provide such centralized state. In this module however, we'll be working with a very simple trimmed down version. In Week 1, we'll explain how you can use this system in our application.

## Handing in homework

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in.

Also review the Git [workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md) from the JavaScript3 module, use this as a reference.
